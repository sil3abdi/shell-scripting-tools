!! READ 'WHAT IS MKSHELL.TXT' BEFORE READING THIS FILE !!

vshell does what mkshell does, but, vshell opens the shell file with vim

which means:
	| creates files | edits files with vim
---------------------------------------------
mksehll |       *      |
---------------------------------------------
vshell  |       *      |          *
