mkshell is the short form of 'make shell"
And simply, you can make shell scripting files using mkshell on the terminal
In order to do that, after moving the mkshell file to '/bin/' type "mkshell file1 file2 file3 .."
featers:
* you don't have to type the file's name with '.sh' in the end but you can
* you can make many files
* I'm too lazy to explain, try it with yourself and you can check the code if you want to learn more about the file
