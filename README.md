<h5>What are "shell scripting tools"</h5>

These tools are made for both linux and mac users in order to make shell scripting easier. 
Each tool and its own guide are in a directory, this directory is made specially for these two files. 
After download the tool that you think it may help you, move the shell file to "/bin/". After doing this, every time you type the file name in the terminal the file will start working. 
Check the folders to know what does each tool do ^-^
